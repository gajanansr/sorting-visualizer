# Sorting Visualizer

## Project Description
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to visualize the working of popular sorting algorithms. It provides an engaging and educational way to understand sorting algorithms such as **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**, and **Bubble Sort**.

Built using **React** and **Vite**, this tool allows users to see the sorting algorithms in action and compare the performance of each algorithm based on array size and animation speed. The app is highly customizable, enabling users to modify the number of bars (array elements) and adjust the animation speed.

## Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes the following sorting algorithms:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- **Customizable Array**: Change the number of bars (array elements) dynamically.
- **Animation Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animations between Fast, Medium, and Slow.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Animations**: JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gajanansr/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**: After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Development Server**: Now, start the development server by running:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

  Now, you should be able to see the Sorting Visualizer running locally!

## Usage

- **Generate New Array**: Click the button to generate a new array of bars with random heights.
- **Sort Array**: Choose an algorithm (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, or Bubble Sort) and watch the sorting process in action.
- **Adjust Speed**: Use the dropdown to select the speed of the animation (Fast, Medium, or Slow).
- **Adjust Bar Count**: Use the slider to change the number of bars in the array.
